# PvZ3: A World-Class Adventure (Windows release)
 Windows release for Plants vs Zombies 3: A World-Class Adventure. Enjoy!

 A couple notes:
1. This build is released for certain people only. This is for bug testing, and gameplay feedback for the next iterations
2. This is the Windows release. There is a potential Android build, but I can't test it (didn't have appropriate device)
3. If there's any bugs/crashes you can find, please report to me in Discord. If possible, also show the steps to reproduce said bugs/crashes
4. Enjoy the game! If there's any mechanics you're confused on, feel free to ask me on Discord
