## PvZ3: A World-Class Adventure (Windows release)
 Windows release for Plants vs Zombies 3: A World-Class Adventure. Enjoy!

# Additions/Changes:
1. Added the second half of the Middle East. The first region is officially completed! Beware of the final boss...
2. Added stickers. Customize your game with these lovely cosmetics. More will be added in the future!
3. More Plants to get and enjoy, including 2 former members of Team Bowling Bulb
4. More Zombies to be encountered. Watch out for mirages, I'm serious.
5. Oil Attack!

# A couple notes:
1. This build is released for certain people only. This is for bug testing, and gameplay feedback for the next iterations
2. This is the Windows release. There is a potential Android build, but I can't test it (didn't have appropriate device)
3. If there's any bugs/crashes you can find, please report to me in Discord. If possible, also show the steps to reproduce said bugs/crashes
4. Click on "PvZ3_WCA" to run. If that doesn't work, navigate to folder Compatible and click on "PvZ3_WCA_OpenGL" instead
5. Enjoy the game! If there's any mechanics you're confused on, feel free to ask me on Discord
