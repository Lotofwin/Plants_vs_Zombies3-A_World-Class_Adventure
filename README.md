# PvZ3: A World-Class Adventure (Windows release)
 Windows release for Plants vs Zombies 3: A World-Class Adventure (3rd iteration). Enjoy!

## Additions/Changes:
1. Add a new costume for Tulip: Lich Headwear. This costume also affect the Seed as well!
2. Add a bit more Tips, and some other small aesthetic changes

## Balancing:
1. Tulip: Health - Base: 350 -> 300. Upgraded: 450 -> 400
- Tulip is the type of Protector that is effective in 1v1 against a Zombie. Having an ability that would make her a "Plant Lich", it is appropriate that she'd have a low amount of Health for her Role. However, it feels appropriate to make her a bit more vulnerable, while still keeping her power level as a Shop Plant.
2. Puff-shroom: Health - Base: 40 -> 20. Upgraded: 55 -> 40
- This is mostly to make the "expendable" status of Puff-shroom even more apparent. Keep in mind that these Puff-shrooms have a Lifespan that can be removed in tandem when using Plant Food, but they are still easier to go down
3. Shisha Zombie - Damage: 500 -> 300
- Originally this game's version of Torchwood Zombie, the high damage was a way to make use of Iceberg Lettuce's and King Protea's abilities. However, the 4x1 range seems to have cause certain issues like way-too-quick burndown of Protectors. Therefore, the damage is drastically reduced, so that it can still roast Plants from a safe distance, but not Wall-nuts that quickly 

## A couple notes:
1. This build is released for certain people only. This is for bug testing, and gameplay feedback for the next iterations
2. This is the Windows release. There is a potential Android build, but I can't test it (didn't have appropriate device)
3. If there's any bugs/crashes you can find, please report to me in Discord. If possible, also show the steps to reproduce said bugs/crashes
4. Click on "PvZ3_WCA" to run. If that doesn't work, navigate to folder Compatible and click on "PvZ3_WCA_OpenGL" instead
5. Enjoy the game! If there's any mechanics you're confused on, feel free to ask me on Discord

## Fun fact of the day
Despite their name, the human's small intestine is actually 3 to 4 times longer than the large intestine. The names are instead referring to their diameter inside our body
